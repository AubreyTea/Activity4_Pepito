        So, Getting to know Me first? The process of reflection is essential to knowing oneself. It involves looking inward and removing the layers of cultural norms and outside influences to find the core of who you really are. Asking yourself difficult questions and being honest with your responses—even when they're difficult or uncomfortable to face—are essential to this process. At the end of the day, knowing oneself involves more than just identifying your talents and shortcomings, likes and dislikes. It involves developing a strong sense of authenticity and self-awareness that enables you to lead a life that is fundamentally genuine to who you are. And may you always find comfort and fortitude in the understanding of your own inner compass as you continue to sail the ever-shifting seas of life.

              Some of my dislikes and dislikes are:
              My likes are I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, Reading books, watching movies, playing with my two cats his name is peanut and butter is something I really like to do in my free time, listening to music, especially worship songs. Tasting my way through the wide world of food delights is one of my favorite things to do. With every delicious taste, a perfectly prepared dish has the ability to stimulate my senses and take me to distant places. There's something quite magical about that. Every cuisine, from Paris flavorful pastas to Paris fiery curries, provides a different window into the many food customs of the world. Life is full of dislikes as much as likes. They aid in our self-understanding and point us in the direction of the things that genuinely make us happy and fulfilled.

              In my dream of going abroad, I discover not only the world beyond my doorstep but also the world within myself. I am challenged to confront my preconceptions and to embrace the unknown with open arms. With each new experience, I grow more confident, more compassionate, and more alive. I wake up from my dream with a renewed sense of purpose and a strong desire to travel. Even after the adventure is over, the memories remain, deeply ingrained in my identity. And when I look out to the horizon, I realize that my desire to travel overseas is a promise that is simply waiting to be realized.
